<p>I'm curious about data analytics. My major focus is the strategic management with accounting and financial data. However, the advent of big data in various fields piqued my interest, and my scope of research and data analytics has now expanded into all aspects of social science.</p>

<p>I earned a Ph.D. and a master's degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. The restaurant industry was a major research field, but it is no longer relevant because there is so much interesting data in the world. So far, I have primarily studied restaurant franchising from a strategic standpoint. My first strength is that I have extensive experience with data analytics. I used to work in a large retail company and analyze various management data. Every week, I had to forecast the margins and analyze the revenue and costs of all branches. It appears simple, but it required significant time and effort. Following my work experience, I received statistical analysis training from graduate school. Statistical analysis proved to be an excellent tool for data analysis. However, most academics fail to distinguish between statistical and strategic significance. In this blog, I'd like to share my thoughts on the subject with you. Second, as a result of my diverse curiosity, I had knowledge in a variety of fields ranging from management to engineering. Science/engineering researchers did not always understand social science researchers. Similarly, the inverse situation occurs. It is due to a lack of knowledge in other areas of study. I'll also express my opinion to you. Finally, I have access to a variety of statistical software, ranging from SPSS to R. Of course, there are many more knowledgeable people than me, but I can share my experiences with you.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk with you in English, but my mother tongue is Korean. Please understand my situation in which I must interact with you in Korean. I can communicate in English whenever you ask. I anticipate your understanding on this matter in advance.</p>
